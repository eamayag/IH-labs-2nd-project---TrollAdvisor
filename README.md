## TROLL ADVISOR:

A review web TripAdvisor style, but now for restaurants (Black Mirror style!). 
Annoying clients? Now you can share opinions about them, avoid having misseducated customers 
and give discounts to those you want to go to your place.

### INSTRUCTIONS: 

Two types of profiles are considered: 
1. *Client*: can register, share personal information and receive discounts (% of discount, number 
of guests, personal message) from the restaurants.
2. *Restaurant*: can register, see info from all clients, see reviews of the clients from all restaurants,
public a review of a client, send a discount (%, guests, personal message) to the customer.
